<h2><b>What is HackerRank?</b></h2>
<p>HackerRank is a popular online platform that provides coding challenges and competitions for software developers, as well as technical skill assessments and interviews for hiring companies. It allows programmers to test their skills and showcase their abilities by solving various coding problems in different programming languages like C, Python, C++, Java etc.</p><br>
<p>The varied answers that programmers provide to HackerRank's coding challenges are referred to as "HackerRank Solutions." Both the automated approach at HackerRank and other users' peer reviews are applied to these solutions. The website offers a learning environment where users may exercise their coding skills, advance their knowledge, and absorb other people's ideas. Programmers wishing to brush up on their coding skills or be ready for technical interviews can also benefit from HackerRank Solutions.</p>
<p>HackerRank can be a vey useful platform for following reasons:
<ol type="1">
<li>Learning: You can learn various programming ideas and techniques by completing coding challenges on HackerRank. With the help of the platform's explanations and tips, you may better understand the reasoning behind the answers to problems and develop your problem-solving abilities.</li> 
<li>Practice: HackerRank offers a huge selection of coding challenges in a variety of programming languages and levels of complexity. As a novice or student, working through these problems can help you develop your programming skills and boost your self-assurance.</li>
<li>Preparation: During the employment process, several businesses utilise HackerRank as a tool to evaluate potential candidates' coding abilities. You can improve your chances of getting a job as a student or beginning by completing coding challenges on HackerRank to help you get ready for technical interviews.
</li>
